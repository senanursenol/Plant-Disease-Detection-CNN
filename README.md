# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection with Custom CNN

**Author:** [Senanur ŞENOL]
**Dataset:** PlantVillage (Kaggle)
**Model Accuracy:** ~93% (Validation)

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect plant diseases from leaf images. The model was trained on the PlantVillage dataset containing 15 classes.

### 🔧 Key Techniques Used:
* **Data Augmentation:** Rotation, flipping, and zooming to prevent overfitting.
* **Custom CNN Architecture:** Increasing filter depth (32 -> 512) to capture complex features.
* **Regularization:** Dropout (0.5) and Batch Normalization.
* **Visualization:** Feature map extraction to understand model focus.

## 📊 Results
The model achieved **93% accuracy** on the validation set. Below are the training performance graphs:

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Download the `Plant_Disease_Detection_CNN.ipynb` file.
2. Upload your `kaggle.json` key to download the dataset.
3. Run the cells sequentially.
